 🧠 Round 1: SQL + Logic
 • “Find the 2nd latest purchase per user.”
 • “Top 3 products by revenue per region — in one query.”
 • “Explain why NOT IN breaks when NULLs are involved.”
 • “How would you optimize a slow query hitting 100M+ rows?”

 I focused on performance, and narrating my thought process out loud.

 ⚙️ Round 2: Data Pipeline Design
 • “How would you design a pipeline to ingest and transform 50M events per day?”
 • “What do you do if a batch job partially fails?”
 • “How do you handle schema drift in a streaming system?”

 Here, I didn’t just name tools.
 I explained recovery patterns, and monitoring strategies.

 💬 Round 3: Stakeholder Round (Behavioral + Systems)
 • “How do you ensure data quality in production?”
 • “Explain pipeline latency to a non-technical business user.”
 • “Tell me about a time you fixed something no one else noticed.”

 This round wasn’t about code. it was about communication, ownership, and clarity.
